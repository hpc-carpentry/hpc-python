Create a file, called `Snakefile`, with no file extension and containing the
following content:

```
# Count words.
rule count_words:
    input:    'books/isles.txt'
    output:   'isles.dat'
    shell:    'python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat'
```
{: .language-python}

This is a [build file]({{ page.root }}/reference/#build-file), which for
Snakemake is called a [Snakefile]({{ page.root }}/reference/#makefile) &mdash;
a file executed by Snakemake. Note that aside from a few keyword additions like
`rule`, it follows standard Python 3 syntax.

Let us go through each line in turn:

* `#` denotes a *comment*. Any text from `#` to the end of the line is
  ignored by Snakemake.
* `isles.dat` is a [target]({{ page.root }}/reference/#target), a file to be
  created, or built. In Snakemake, these are called "outputs", for simplicity's
  sake.
* `books/isles.txt` is a [dependency]({{ page.root }}/reference/#dependency), a
  file that is needed to build or update the target. Targets can have zero or
  more dependencies. Dependencies in Snakemake are called "inputs".
* `python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat` is an [action]({{ page.root
  }}/reference/#action), a command to run to build or update the target using
  the dependencies. In this case the action is a set of shell commands (we can
  also use Python code... more on that later).
* Like Python, you can use either tabs or spaces for indentation &mdash;
  don't use both!
* Together, the target, dependencies, and actions form a [rule](
  {{ page.root }}/reference/#rule). A rule is a recipe for how to make things.

Our rule above describes how to build the target `isles.dat` using the
action `python wordcount.py` and the dependency `books/isles.txt`.

Information that was implicit in our shell script - that we are
generating a file called `isles.dat` and that creating this file
requires `books/isles.txt` - is now made explicit by Snakemake's syntax.

Let's first ensure we start from scratch and delete the `.dat` and `.png`
files we created earlier:

```
$ rm *.dat *.png
```
{: .language-bash}

By default, Snakemake looks for a file called `Snakefile`, and we can
run Snakemake as follows:

```
$ snakemake
```
{: .language-bash}

By default, Snakemake tells us what it's doing as it executes actions:

```
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words
        1

rule count_words:
    input: books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) done
```
{: .output}

Depending on your setup, you may receive an error 
`Error: you need to specify the maximum number of CPU cores to be used at the 
same time with --cores.` 
This can be fixed using an argument to the sankemake command.
Try running the following:

```
$ snakemake --cores 1
```
{: .language-bash}

If you see a different error, check your syntax and the filepaths of the files
in your Snakefile.
You can check your present working directory using the command `pwd`.

Remember, aside from stuff like `rule` and `input`,
Snakemake follows Python syntax.
Let's see if we got what we expected:

```
$ head -5 isles.dat
```
{: .language-bash}

The first 5 lines of `isles.dat` should look exactly like before.

> We don't have to call our Snakefile `Snakefile`. However, if we call it

> {: .language-bash}
{: .callout}

When we re-run our Snakefile, Snakemake now informs us that:

```
Nothing to be done.
```
{: .output}

This is because our target, `isles.dat`, has now been created, and
Snakemake will not create it again. To see how this works, let's pretend to
update one of the text files. Rather than opening the file in an
editor, we can use the shell `touch` command to update its timestamp
(which would happen if we did edit the file):

```
$ touch books/isles.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

If we compare the timestamps of `books/isles.txt` and `isles.dat`,

```
$ ls -l books/isles.txt isles.dat
```
{: .language-bash}

then we see that `isles.dat`, the target, is now older
than`books/isles.txt`, its dependency:

```
-rw-r--r--    1 mjj      Administ   323972 Jun 12 10:35 books/isles.txt
-rw-r--r--    1 mjj      Administ   182273 Jun 12 09:58 isles.dat
```
{: .output}

If we run Snakemake again,

```
$ snakemake
```
{: .language-bash}

then it recreates `isles.dat`:

```
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words
        1

rule count_words:
    input: books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) done
```
{: .output}

When it is asked to build a target, Snakemake checks the "last modification
time" of both the target and its dependencies. If any dependency has
been updated since the target, then the actions are re-run to update
the target. Using this approach, Snakemake knows to only rebuild the files
that, either directly or indirectly, depend on the file that
changed. 
This is called an [incremental build](
{{ page.root }}/reference/#incremental-build).

{: .callout}

Let's add another rule to the end of `Snakefile`.
Note that rules cannot have the same name,
so we'll call this one `count_words_abyss`.

```
rule count_words_abyss:
    input:    'books/abyss.txt'
    output:   'abyss.dat'
    shell:    'python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat'
```
{: .language-make}

If we run Snakemake,

```
$ snakemake
```
{: .language-bash}

then we get:

```
Nothing to be done.
```
{: .output}

Nothing happens because Snakemake attempts to build the first target it
finds in the Snakefile, the [default target](
{{ page.root }}/reference/#default-target), 
which is `isles.dat` which is already up-to-date.
We need to explicitly tell Snakemake we want to build `abyss.dat`:

```
$ snakemake abyss.dat
```
{: .language-bash}

Now, we get:

```
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words_abyss
        1

rule count_words_abyss:
    input: books/abyss.txt
    output: abyss.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) doneat
```
{: .output}

{: .callout}

We may want to remove all our data files so we can explicitly recreate
them all. We can introduce a new target, and associated rule, to do
this. We will call it `clean`, as this is a common name for rules that
delete auto-generated files, like our `.dat` files:

```
rule clean:
    shell: 'rm -f *.dat'
```
{: .language-make}

This is an example of a rule that has no inputs or outputs!
We just want to remove the data files whether or not they exist.
If we run Snakemake and specify this target,

```
$ snakemake clean
```
{: .language-bash}

then we get:

```
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       clean
        1

rule clean:
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) done
```
{: .output}

An `ls` of our current directory reveals that all of our troublesome output
files are now gone (as planned)!

We can add a similar command to create all the data files. We can put
this at the top of our Snakefile so that it is the [default target](
{{ page.root }}/reference/#default-target), which is executed by default
if no target is given to the `snakemake` command:

```
rule dats:
    input:
        'isles.dat',
        'abyss.dat'
```
{: .language-make}

This is an example of a rule that has dependencies that are targets of
other rules. When `snakemake` runs, it will check to see if the dependencies
exist and, if not, will see if rules are available that will create
these. If such rules exist it will invoke these first, otherwise
`snakemake` will raise an error.

> ## Dependencies
>
> The order of rebuilding dependencies is arbitrary. You should not
> assume that they will be built in the order in which they are
> listed.
>
> Dependencies must form a directed acyclic graph. A target cannot
> depend on a dependency which itself, or one of its dependencies,
> depends on that target.
{: .callout}

This rule is also an example of a rule that has no actions. It is used
purely to trigger the build of its dependencies, if needed.

If we run,

```
$ snakemake dats
```
{: .language-bash}

then snakemake creates the data files:

```
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words
        1       count_words_abyss
        1       dats
        3

rule count_words_abyss:
    input: books/abyss.txt
    output: abyss.dat
    jobid: 1

Finished job 1.
1 of 3 steps (33%) done

rule count_words:
    input: books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 2

Finished job 2.
2 of 3 steps (67%) done

localrule dats:
    input: isles.dat, abyss.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
3 of 3 steps (100%) done
```
{: .output}

If we run `dats` again, then snakemake will see that the dependencies
(`isles.dat` and `abyss.dat`) are already up to date.
Given the target `dats` has no actions, there is `nothing to be done`:

```
$ snakemake dats
```
{: .language-bash}
```
Nothing to be done
```
{: .output}

Our Snakefile now looks like this:

```
rule dats:
     input:
         'isles.dat',
         'abyss.dat'


# delete everything so we can re-run things
rule clean:
    shell: 'rm -f *.dat'


# count words in one of our "books"
rule count_words:
    input:    'books/isles.txt'
    output:   'isles.dat'
    shell:    'python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat'


rule count_words_abyss:
    input:    'books/abyss.txt'
    output:   'abyss.dat'
    shell:    'python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat'
```
{: .language-make}

The following figure shows a graph of the dependencies embodied within
our Snakefile, involved in building the `dats` target:

{% include figure.html url="" caption="" max-width="40%"
   file="/fig/02-dats-dag.svg"
   alt="Dependencies represented within the Snakefile" %}

At this point, it becomes important to see what Snakemake is doing behind the
scenes.
What commands is Snakemake actually running?
Snakemake has a special option (`-p`), 
that prints every command it is about to run.
Additionally, we can also perform a dry run with `-n`.
A dry run does nothing, and simply prints out commands instead of actually
executing them.
Very useful for debugging!

```
$ snakemake clean
$ snakemake -n -p isles.dat
```
{: .language-bash}
```
rule count_words:
    input: wordcount.py, books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 0
    wildcards: file=isles

python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	count_words
	1
```
